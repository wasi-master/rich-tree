## Usage

The library is still in beta so expect some bugs.

Firstly you'll need to install it from github using [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip "The python package manager")

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/wasi-master/rich-tree
```

Then you can run the `rtree` command or `python -m rtree` command to view the tree. Run `rtree --help` for more information
